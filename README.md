To my lovely self,

I know you are curious and adventurous. And you live to make the world a better place; putting smiles on peoples' faces. Your interest for Bioinformics has led you here. I remember your dream of finding cure for HIV. I hope this path of programming will lead you there.

Keep your passion burning,
From your reasonable mind.
